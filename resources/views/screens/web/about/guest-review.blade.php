                                    Tabouli, but since after it was already rung up, they did not charge. While it wasn't on
                                    the receipt and wasn't included in the food delivered, the driver came back 15 minutes
                                    later to drop it off and we didn't even call to say it was missing. Impressive Customer

                                    kababs" so I had to try it out. On my way to Milwaukee from Bloomington, I took a 10
                                    min. detour off I94 and let me tell you...my friends were right! This is the best kabab
                                    joint you'll find!! We've traveled the world and I must say...I will be making pit stops
                                    each time I travel throuh Chicago! I had a ribeye, a chicken, and a shrimp kabab. The
                                    shrimp seemed a little overdone, but the flavor was amazing! I can't wait to return!</p>

                                    American and we both are addicted to this place. We also had our wedding dinner from
                                    Noon o Kabob and hands down all our guests said that was the best wedding dinner they've
                                    ever had, except one person and he said that's the second best ;) Even now that we don't
                                    have a car and we have to commute for about an hour, we still make sure to come at least
                                    once a month. Food is fresh and very authentic. My husband're favorite is Fessenjoon
                                    (which I just ordered YUM) and they use real pomegranate sauce, unlike some places that
                                    seem to use ketchup! Food is delicious, ambiance is beautiful, and people are great.
                                    I've been coming to noon o kabob for 10 years now and never get tired of this place! I
                                    just wish they would come to downtown :) I have a perfect place for them! So Thank you
                                    for bringing the best authentic Persian food for all Iranian who miss it and for
                                    everyone else who loves good food!</p>

                                <p class="review-dis-text">My Daughter, son in law and my 3 granddaughters visited me from
                                    out of town over the July 4th weekend. Because they were only in for a few days, and
                                    because of all the people (23) wanting to see them, I had a back yard party on July 5th.
                                    When I started planning it I normally thought I would have to cook all the food myself.
                                    Well that’s when I thought it might be nice to have it catered so I could spend the time
                                    enjoying my grandkids. Well the first place I thought of was Noon O Kabab. This is
                                    because it has the perfect food for an informal gathering. I also knew that every time I
                                    go to eat at Noon O Kabab the food was always cooked perfectly, tastes great, always
                                    have big portions and is made with quality ingredients. I ordered the chicken and
                                    koubideh kababs, the dill rice, some hummus, baba ghannouj appetizers. The kababs also
                                    came with all the extras that you get at the restaurant – pita, onions, feta, parsley,
                                    grilled tomatoes, onions and green pepper. It was all delivered hot – not over cooked -
                                    right on time and was at a very reasonable price. Everyone there raved about everything.
                                    How tasty the kababs were, that the dill rice was delicious and what wonderful
                                    appetizers. I had many tell me it was the best kababs and hummus they ever had. I even
                                    received a thank you letter that mentioned their food. Well it’s the smartest thing I’ve
                                    done in a while. I highly recommend either stopping by to eat or having your next party
                                    or event catered by Noon O Kabab. Thanks to the staff for a job well done.</p>

                                    outside Iran. The place is so tastefully decorated and the food is so great that even
                                    Los Angeles Persian restaurants could not compare to it. The owners are all family
                                    members and very friendly and treat you like a guest in their house. Everything on the
                                    menu is delicious as it is made more like homemade food, my favorite of all time is
                                    Joojeh Kabob. I would make a trip to Chicago just to dine there. I can not wait to visit
                                    Chicago again and dine there. A great place to impress business/corproate clients.</p>
